# C++ Testing Framework for Text-Based Input and Output

This project is a comprehensive C++ testing framework designed to streamline the testing of text-based input and output for programs. The framework is equipped with several utility scripts that simplify common tasks, enhancing the ease of use and efficiency for developers. This framework was created to make the CS240 programming assignments easier and more efficient.

## Key Features:
- **Text-Based I/O Testing:** Facilitates thorough testing of text-based input and output to ensure program correctness.
- **Regex Formatting:** Supports test case formatting using regular expressions, allowing for flexible and robust test definitions.
- **Utility Scripts:** Includes a variety of scripts to automate and simplify tasks, making the testing process more efficient.
- **Organized Test Cases:** The tests folder is structured to contain well-organized test cases, ensuring easy management and execution.
- **Output Comparison:** Displays the differences between the expected output and the actual output in the terminal for all test cases, making it easy to identify and correct discrepancies.

This framework is ideal for developers looking to automate and streamline their testing processes, particularly for applications that rely heavily on text-based interactions.
